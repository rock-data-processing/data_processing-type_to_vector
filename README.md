### The Type-To-Vector Library

This library can be used to convert typed ROCK data structures understood by orogen into raw data vectors. This is highly useful when writing type-agnostic components, e.g data filters, learning algorithms or statistics. Although this library can be used standalone, it is recommended to use orogen-type_to_vector for creating type-agnostic Rock components.
